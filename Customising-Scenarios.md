# Customising Scenarios

Use the levers below to reshape any scenario so it fits your learners’ needs, time‑box or difficulty level.

## Change Intensity
| Direction | How to do it |
|-----------|--------------|
| **Increase** | Make the AI character more emotional, aggressive or resistant. Use stronger language and interrupt more often. |
| **Decrease** | Make the AI character more open, less defensive and quicker to accept explanations or compromise. |

## Reverse Roles
Swap the AI and user positions. For example, let the AI play the manager while the learner plays the challenging employee. Adjust aims and challenges accordingly.

## Alter Power Dynamics
Change the seniority (e.g. peer‑to‑peer, junior challenging senior). Rewrite context lines to reflect the hierarchy change.

## Modify the Context
- Switch the setting: remote vs. in‑person, private vs. public.
- Add pressures: looming deadline, media attention, regulatory audit.

## Vary the Outcome Stakes
- **Raise stakes:** dismissal risk, public scandal, high financial loss.  
- **Lower stakes:** informal coaching conversation, small process tweak.

## Adjust the Evidence
- Supply more or less evidence for the manager/user.  
- Inject ambiguity or conflicting accounts to increase complexity.

## Add a Third Party
Bring in a witness, mediator or observer to shift the dynamic. Either party can appeal to this third person for support.
